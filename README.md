# Blockchain-Based Restaurant Health Inspection Management

A decentralized solution for transparent, tamper-proof health inspection management in the food service industry.

## Overview

This blockchain system creates an immutable record of restaurant health inspections, violations, and remediations. It enables transparency for consumers, accountability for establishments, and efficient processes for regulatory bodies.

## Key Components

### Establishment Verification Contract
- Validates legitimate food service operations
- Stores essential business credentials and permits
- Creates digital identity for restaurants within the system
- Prevents fraudulent establishments from participating

### Inspection Scheduling Contract
- Manages timing of regulatory visits
- Implements pseudo-random scheduling to prevent manipulation
- Allows risk-based frequency adjustment
- Maintains verifiable inspection history

### Violation Tracking Contract
- Records identified health code issues
- Creates permanent, timestamped documentation of violations
- Categorizes violations by severity and type
- Links photographic evidence and inspector notes

### Remediation Verification Contract
- Confirms resolution of cited problems
- Validates corrective actions through secondary inspections
- Updates violation status in real-time
- Maintains compliance history for each establishment
